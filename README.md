**Contacts**

Contacts app with full CRUD capabilities. I added a good amount of validation and small features throughout. Extra transient properties (age), mapping the zip code, calling the phone numbers, etc...

I also added a button in the upper left (main "Contacts" screen) that will download, parse, and merge 1,000 contacts from a JSON on a background thread. The merge will not create duplicates. It will replace any of the 1,000 contacts you delete though. 

Since it's late, I'm going to look through it again in the morning to see if I can catch any bugs. :)

Let me know if you have any additional questions.

Thanks!
Mike
